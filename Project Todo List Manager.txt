Project: Todo List Manager

Explanation:

This project will be a console-based application where users can interact with their to-do list. Let's break down the main functionalities:

Add Task: Users can add a new task to their to-do list.

View Tasks: Users can view their current list of tasks along with their completion status.

Mark Task as Complete: Users can mark a task as complete.




Explanation of Code:

We define a Task struct to represent individual tasks with a description and completion status.
The TodoList class encapsulates the task management functionalities.
In the main function, a loop presents a menu for the user to choose actions.
Depending on the user's choice, the appropriate methods of the TodoList class are called.
This project provides a simple example of object-oriented programming in C++, handling user input, and managing data using classes and vectors. It's a basic starting point that you can expand upon with additional features like saving tasks to a file or setting due dates for tasks.
